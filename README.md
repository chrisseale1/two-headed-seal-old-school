# two-headed-seal-old-school
This is a personal site done for two-headed seal, our (Chris Seale & Jessica Larsen) web design firm. It was built from scratch with html, CSS, and Javascript.  It serves as a basis to design and redesign to our specs.  In addtion, we'll be rebuilding the site in multiple frameworks over time to show our competence with those frameworks.
