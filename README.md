# two-headed-seal-old-school
This is a personal site done for two-headed seal, our (Chris Seale & Jessica Larsen) web design firm. It was built from scratch with html and CSS.  It serves as a basis to design and redesign to our specs.  In addtion, we'll be rebuilding the site in multiple frameworks over time to show our competence with those frameworks. We'll also be experimenting with different effects in multiple languages.  Currently we are at release 1.1 and will be updating releases as we move forward with documentation in the readme each time.   

Current Version: Release 1.1
